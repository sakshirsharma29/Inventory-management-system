# Inventory-management-system

# Problem Statement:
In small businesses or personal setups, tracking stock items manually becomes inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to build a simple, user-friendly inventory management tool with a graphical interface that allows non-technical users to manage stock efficiently.

# Project Overview:
This is a desktop-based Inventory Management System built using Python's Tkinter GUI library. It enables users to add, update, delete, search, and export inventory items. The application also displays all items in a live-updating table and allows exporting the inventory to a .csv file for backup or further analysis.
